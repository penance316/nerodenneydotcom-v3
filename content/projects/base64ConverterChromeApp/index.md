title: Base64 Converter Chrome App

An app I made for the Chrome App store that can convert text and files to and from base64 encoded strings. I made this app for my own use as I found myself needing this functionality a lot within some other projects I was working on. I like the idea of Chrome Apps and noticed there was not a simple easy to use app like this in the store already.
