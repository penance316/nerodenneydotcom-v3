      <title>Base64 Converter Progressive WebApp</title>

      <guid>https://nerodenney.com/projects/2016-11-28-project-8/</guid>
      <description>A utility to encode/decode strings and files into base64. This is a remake of my Chrome app due to Google ending support for Chrome apps. I used progressive techniques including offline mode so this web app can function much more like a traditional mobile app.

      <title>Base64 Converter Chrome App</title>

      <guid>https://nerodenney.com/projects/2014-07-18-project-1/</guid>
      <description>An app I made for the Chrome App store that can convert text and files to and from base64 encoded strings. I made this app for my own use as I found myself needing this functionality a lot within some other projects I was working on. I like the idea of Chrome Apps and noticed there was not a simple easy to use app like this in the store already.</description>

      <title>Groundsure GIS Ordering Platform</title>
      <link>https://nerodenney.com/projects/2014-07-16-project-3/</link>

      <guid>https://nerodenney.com/projects/2014-07-16-project-3/</guid>
      <description>I helped design and develop a GIS based ordering platform for environmental reports used during land and property acquisition. This project involved heavy use of the ESRI mapping framework and Microsoft’s TypeScript project. As this is a commercial application I cannot go into too much detail regarding specific implementation or environmental details about this project.
